# Frontend Mentor - Social proof section

![Design preview for the Social proof section coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

This will be a first in a series of challenges from [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) that I'm gonna be doing to help me train my skills in Front-end development. I'm gonna be styling this using Sass, so I'll get used to using it moving forward.
